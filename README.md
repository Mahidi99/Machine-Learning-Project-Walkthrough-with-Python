# Machine-Learning-Project-Walkthrough-with-Python

Here this project will take us through a complete Machine Learning Project Walkthrough with Python programming language. This complete machine learning project walkthrough includes the implementation of algorithms provided by Scikit-Learn which is one of the best Python libraries for Machine Learning.

Below are the steps that are covered in this Machine Learning project walkthrough:

1. Importing the Data
2. Data Visualization
3. Data Cleaning and Transformation
4. Encoding the Data
5. Splitting the data into Training and Test sets
6. Fine Tuning Algorithms
7. Cross Validate with KFold
8. Prediction on the test set
